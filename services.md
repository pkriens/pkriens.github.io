# Services

Building a new system is a treacherous enterprise with sirens and rocks on the way, as all developers can testify. Over
time development teams learn their domain and the development becomes more predictable. The IoT revolution is
special because it is an overlap of large enterprise like systems combined with gateways and small embedded devices. Since
OSGi software can seamlessly move between most of these environments, due to its service model, it is ideal for IoT.

Since IoT overlaps multiple domains is very likely that existing development teams have to leave their comfort zone and learn new
technologies. For enterprise developers it is hard to get used to a severely constrained environment. For embedded developers Java is
often new and the threats of open connectivity require very careful designs. 

aQute can provide assistance in many different ways when your company wants to create a new product, or modify an existing product,
for the IoT world. This ranges from a management's sounding board for different business cases (and models), architectural design, mentoring the new technologies,
turn key developments, or handling the logistics to get together the right world wide experts in one (tele) conference room. Our primary goal is to help 
you learn the technology so we can move on to the next customer's task.
