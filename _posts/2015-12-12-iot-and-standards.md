# IoT and Standards

About 8 years ago Apple steamrolled the mobile telephony industry with the first iPhone. 
They drastically disrupted the symbiosis of operators and device manufacturers. Nokia 
and Motorola did not survive this mayhem and knowing the operators of 15 years 
ago they are still have not recovered.

After visiting the ETSI OneM2M workshop in Nice for three days I am wondering if 
history will repeat itself? It feels like the telecom industry never analyzed why 
Apple ate their lunch and thought about how to defend itself against the next attack. 
In the workshop the work is about standardizing protocols, abstract reference semantic
 reference models, and maybe some open source influence. The underlying rationale is 
 the somewhat tired lesson that collaborating on protocols will enable interoperability, 
 which will increase the pie many times. True, but how do we prevent that an Apple will 
 come again and steal the pie under our nose?

Apple succeeded so easily because it hit the soft underbelly of the mobile telekom 
industry: software. Software was proprietary in the telekom industry, protocols were 
paramount. Only after NTT Docomo succeeded on generating revenues on applications 
did the industry enable a severely crippled software model on the phones. I did 
participate in an attempt of Motorola, Nokia, IBM and others to set a better 
software standard based on OSGi just before the iPhone hit. I can ensure you that 
we didn't stand a chance because the focus was on irrelevant aspects like managing 
the device, constraining the application developer, and lowering the cost. Instead 
the focus should have been on what independent developers could do with a programmable device.

The rest was history.

The iPhone enabled Facebook, WhatsApp, Google Maps, and all of the other millions of 
applications because anybody could write cool applications for it which is the truest 
source of innovation.

The telekom industry is now sitting on the fence of  a huge new market: The Internet 
of Things. The industry is eminently suited to provide the connectivity and having 
first row access to the humongous pie of IoT services. Instead of learning the lessons 
of the mobile telephone industry it feels like history will repeat itself.

It is the software, stupid!
