# Declarative Services and Concurrency

I've just finished a rather extensive application note about concurrency and other
time related issues for a customer. I've shared this application note with
permission on the OSGi enRoute website. You can find it [here](http://aqute.biz/appnotes/concurrency.html).

The App note is providing some common background about time related issues. It
discusses the Java memory model but then provides a large number of example of
how to use Java in the concurrent world that OSGi is.

All examples are provided as a Bndtools workspace including a test case so they
can be explored in the debugger. You find the workspace [here](https://github.com/osgi/osgi.enroute.examples.concurrency).

Enjoy and feedback is as always highly appreciated.
