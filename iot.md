# IoT is Coming

The Internet of Things is coming if one can believe the press. Is it another hype or is it real? Though the actual 
situation is likely a mix of of both it is clear that something is happening. The steep drop of
hardware prices is enabling solutions that for short were unthinkable. Adding connectivity to
industrial and consumer appliances today add surprisingly little to the BOM but can potentially generate 
significant revenue if translated to the proper business cases. It can even provide a completely different
business model. Once jet engines could be connected to their management systems General Electric could move 
from selling these engines to  flying hours. From a business model with a one time revenue when the 
product is sold to a recurring revenue.

## The Unknowns


## Assi
aQute provides a wide palette of services for manufacturers that consider connecting
products to the Internet. A wild west place, moving at warp speed, under constant attack, that clearly contains
many pitfalls. aQute can be a partner in the product development team that provides
the mentoring to make the organization learn this new domain without making costly mistakes.

An important theme for aQute is OSGi, a modular software technology for Internet systems based on Java. 
OSGi provides the philosophy and the foundation for many of our (technical) solutions. 
Our people have intricately been involved with the development of OSGi since 1998 and know as the best
how to apply this technology in embedded as well as large system scenarios.
