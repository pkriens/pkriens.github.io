# You got a Broken link, Don't Panic

This site underwent a major redesign and in the process a lot of information was removed because
it was stale. However, much of this information was widely linked on the net. So you're likely
a victim of the downside of a hyperlinked system without distributed garbage collection mechanisms.
Our sincere excuses. We can provide you the following help to locate the information you
need. If you still can't find it, do not hesitate to [contact](contact) us.

## Articles, Presentations, etc.

The previous incarnation of this site contained a lot of
OSGi related information that was removed because it was 
old and confused people. Presentations, articles, etc.  Much of this
information can be found on the [Github repository][1] that
backs this website. And don't forget to consult the
[OSGi Alliance's][4] website of course.

## OSGi Tutorials and Presentations

If you are looking for OSGi information, we suggest
you consult the [OSGi enRoute][3] website. This web site
is the best resource to learn and understand OSGi. We 
are proud to have contributed significantly to OSGi
enRoute and highly recommend it to learn about OSGi.

## The Manual of bnd and Bndtools

The most often sought document on the previous incarnation of
site was the bnd manual. Since bnd was originally an
aQute project (bnd still uses its pacakge namespace)
this site hosted the manual. However, to make it more
neutral (and easier to maintain) we therefore moved it to
[bnd.bndtools.org][2].
