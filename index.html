  <p>The Internet of Things is coming if one can believe the press. Is it another hype or is it real? Though the actual 
  situation is likely a mix of of both it is clear that something is happening. The steep drop of
  hardware prices is enabling solutions that for short were unthinkable. Adding connectivity to
  industrial and consumer appliances today add surprisingly little to the BOM but can potentially generate 
  significant revenue if translated to the proper business cases. It can even provide a completely different
  business model like General Electric moved from selling engines to flying hours.
  <p>
  aQute provides a wide palette of services for manufacturers that consider connecting
  products to the Internet. A wild west place, moving at warp speed, under constant attack, that clearly contains
  many pitfalls. aQute can be a partner in the product development team that provides
  the mentoring to make the organization learn this new domain without making costly mistakes.
  <p>
  An important theme for aQute is OSGi, a modular software technology for Internet systems based on Java. 
  OSGi provides the philosophy and the foundation for many of our (technical) solutions. 
  Our people have intricately been involved with the development of OSGi since 1998 and know as the best
  how to apply this technology in embedded as well as large system scenarios.
