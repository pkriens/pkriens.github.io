## About aQute

Software has been my life since my first programmable calculator in 1976 blew away
my mind. In the eighties this happened again when I discovered [Smalltalk]
after which I became a (professional) evangelist for [OO]. While working for 
[Ericsson Research] in the nineties I was part of founding the [OSGi Alliance]. 
The microservices in OSGi _avant la lettre_, blew my mind away again.

I am proud to have played a key role in the development of OSGi as the
specifications editor and in other roles. As the lead developer  of [bnd], a key open source 
component of the OSGi tooling, several [Apache Felix] projects, 
and [OSGi enRoute] I've contributed to  make OSGi easier to use. This all
made me one of the five OSGi Fellows.

However, I also worked with  small and large companies to integrate the technology 
into their products and tools providing different [services]. As business developer, architect, teacher, 
mentor, consultant, sparring partner, or developer I could help the organization to 
make effective use of the technology as quickly as possible. Working with these companies
taught me a lot about the wide spectrum of technologies
but also about the human aspects of software development.

aQute is a _small_ company by choice because we can tap into a large international network 
of developers. This allows us to stay agile but still offer a  large number of services 
in your local language, which makes learning new technologies a lot easier. 

Therefore, if you consider using OSGi, then I am sure we can make the difference!
